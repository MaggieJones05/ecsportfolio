	 <p> Hisotry is one of my favorite things to learn because it is never ending and is very interesting. Abother reason I love history is because of the ties it gives me to my past and my dad and grandma. I love all hisotry but specifiaclly love to learn about my family history and the events between 1900's to 1980's.</p>
